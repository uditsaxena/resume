\section*{Work Experience}
\textbf{Microsoft Research}, Bangalore, India \hfill Dec 2014 -- Jun 2016\\
\emph{Research Fellow}\\
\vspace{-6mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improved the quality of ads displayed to Bing users in response to their search queries. Our system was shipped
to different Bing Ads markets like UK, Germany. The problem was posed as a supervised machine learning problem. Joint
work with the Bing Ads team and Dr. Manik Varma (Microsoft Research India).
\vspace{-2mm}
\item Added FastXML (an algorithm for solving ``Extreme Multi-labeling'' problem) to the machine
learning toolkit used inside Microsoft. This involved writing and integrating the algorithm's code
with the toolkit's codebase. As part of this process we also improved the training time by 15\% and reduced the
memory consumption by 50\%.
